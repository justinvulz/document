= Abstract 
The critical group, also known as the sandpile group or Jacobian group, is a finite abelian group that reflects the combinatorial and algebraic properties of a graph. This project focuses on the critical group of the $n$-cube graph $Q_n$ 
, a structure central to both theoretical and applied graph theory.
